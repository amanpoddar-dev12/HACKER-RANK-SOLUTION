# Task

# Now, let's use our knowledge of sets and help Mickey.

# Ms. Gabriel Williams is a botany professor at District College. One day, she asked her student Mickey to compute the average of all the plants with distinct heights in her greenhouse.

# Formula used:

# Function Description

# Complete the average function in the editor below.

# average has the following parameters:

# int arr: an array of integers
# Returns

# float: the resulting float value rounded to 3 places after the decimal
# Input Format

# The first line contains the integer, , the size of .
# The second line contains the  space-separated integers, .

# Constraints


# Sample Input

# STDIN                                       Function
# -----                                       --------
# 10                                          arr[] size N = 10
# 161 182 161 154 176 170 167 171 170 174     arr = [161, 181, ..., 174]
# Sample Output

# 169.375

    return (sum(set(array))/len(set(array))) #it returns sum of element which is in the set. And it devided by ken of an array after converting in set for not get the dublicate element from the list.
